## General Information

This repository contains our new and improved dictionary application that allows users to search and learn new words they are unfamiliar with through visual context, various definitions by part of speech, synonyms & antonyms, and the word origin. Users will also be able to search random words with a click of a button to learn quirky words they might not have ever considered searching for.

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Foundation
- Axios
- Javascript

## Project Requirements

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
