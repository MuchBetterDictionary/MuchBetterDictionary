## General Information

This repository contains our new and improved dictionary application that allows users to search and learn new words they are unfamiliar with through visual context, various definitions by part of speech, synonyms & antonyms, and the word origin. Users will also be presented with a unique word of the day to learn quirky words they might not have ever considered searching for.

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Foundation
- Javascript

- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
